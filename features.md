# Road Trippin' Wiki

## National Parks in the US where people should go road trippin'

1. There is a Main page and a How To Edit (for those unfamiliar with markdown format) pages on the left panel for those new to the page. The Site History will show all that has been going on, except for deletions. It's still in the works.

2. To add a park, you must first be an author. Add yourself to the site (your username must be unique) and then you can start adding your favorite national parks.

3. After adding a park, you will be rerouted to the Table of Contents page, where all the parks exisiting in the wiki are displayed. 

4. From there you can click on a park to see the contents. There are also links to the page history and page discussions. If you would like to keep up with the updates of the site, input your email at the bottom of the page and hit subscribe. If you would like to delete the page or a section, check the box next to it and hit delete.

5. The discussions from the park page are a free for all. Start a new discussion or reply to an existing one by providing your name. If you would like to delete your reply or discussion, hit the delete button.

6. To check out all the authors of the pages, click on Authors in the left panel. To learn more about them and what they've contributed to, click to their page.

7. To search through the site, type a keyword into the search input on the right corner and hit search. A list of pages where your keyword was found will show up with links to click to them. 

8. More features to come but that's all for now.
